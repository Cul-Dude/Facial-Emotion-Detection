# FACIAL EMOTION AI

# Introduction
Emotion AI, also known as affective computing, is a field within artificial intelligence that focuses on recognizing, interpreting, and responding to human emotions. This technology aims to enable machines to understand and simulate human affective processes, making human-computer interactions more intuitive and responsive.
Common methods include computer vision for facial expression analysis, natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis in text and speech, and machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and classification.

# Aim
This project aims to classify people's emotions and expressions based on their facial images. This project utilizes over 20000 human facial images to train a model that can tell how is the person feeling. 

# Problem Statement
This technology, to enable machines to understand and simulate human emotions is essential to make human-computer interactions more intuitive and responsive. This can be particularly useful in scenarios such as:

* **Customer Service:** Enhancing customer interactions by providing more empathetic and tailored responses.
* **Healthcare:** Monitoring patient emotions and mental health conditions, such as detecting signs of depression or stress.
* **Education**: Adapting learning experiences based on student emotions to improve engagement and outcomes.
* **Marketing**: Analyzing consumer emotions to understand preferences and improve product recommendations.
* **Entertainment**: Creating more immersive and emotionally engaging experiences in games and virtual reality.


# How it works
The project uses Deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras to build 2 Convolutional Neural Networks.

1) **Importing necessary libraries and the dataset** Like NumPy, pandas, seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras OpenCV.
2) **Data Preprocessing and Data Augmentation:** Did data preprocessing like converting the image to grayscale, with adjusted pixel values. Also, augmented data like inverting images, flipping images, and changing brightness.3
3) **Model's Architecture**: Developed two CNN models, which when used together, give us the required output.
4) **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance by getting accuracy and making the confusion matrix.


# Development Scope:

Emotion AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries by making technology more attuned to human emotions, ultimately enhancing user experiences and improving interactions between humans and machines

With integration with other AI technologies, such as conversational agents and autonomous systems, advancement in deep learning and multimodal data analysis, more accurate and sophisticated Emotion AI systems can be developed.
